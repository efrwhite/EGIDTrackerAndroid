# EGID Tracker

## Overview

EGID Tracker is an Android application developed to assist parents and caregivers in managing and coordinating care for children with Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID), primarily Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). This app empowers users to monitor symptoms, medications, and dietary requirements, while also providing educational resources to better understand and manage this complex condition.

### Research Basis

The development of EGID Tracker is grounded in the need for effective care coordination tools for children with EoE, as identified in previous studies. Research highlights the importance of information management systems in improving follow-up visits, increasing referrals, and ensuring access to accurate and up-to-date information for families. Mobile health (mHealth) applications have been proven effective in care coordination for chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, demonstrating their potential for EoE care.

## Key Features

- Patient Profiles: Create and manage multiple profiles for children, caregivers, and patients.

- Symptom Tracker: Log daily symptoms and their severity to monitor trends over time.

- Medication Management: Track prescribed medications, dosages, and schedules.

- Dietary Management: Maintain a record of daily diets, avoid accidental exposures, and access a comprehensive list of restricted foods.

- Surveys: Complete quality-of-life and symptom checker surveys to monitor patient well-being.

- Reports and Endoscopy Results: Save and organize important documents, including endoscopy results and other medical reports.

- Educational Resources: Access a detailed page with information about EoE, including causes, symptoms, affected populations, and treatment options.

## Future Expansion

While the current version of EGID Tracker is designed for parents and caregivers, future iterations aim to include functionality for older patients to manage their own care.
